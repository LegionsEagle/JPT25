leave airport en-route to [hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/81F4PxX26HWt66He9)
	double check that we have everything that we left with before leaving airport
#### Friday 4/11/24
##### at hotel
clean up
	plan to go through akihabara for exploration
		After dark, plan to go down to akihabara to walk around
		Main Street akihabara runs along the Tokyo metro ginza line.
			Kandamyojin-dori Street (southern side) and Kuramaibashi-Dori avenue (northern side), though there are still some cool spots to check out further south and north of the aforementioned streets
		Appears to sit mostly between, This visit will likely be one of several, there is not much need to go for specifics
			Wonder around mostly aimlessly, keep some ideas as we walk for places to double back on (I.e. shopping/food/further exploration), otherwise there for the view
		return to hotel whenever we give up on walking
			adjust for specifics later

#### Saturday 4/12/25
asakusa
	[tokyo skytree](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1680/) set ticket purchase for 11:00 a.m. plan on arriving at skytree at around 10:30
	Sensoji temple
	Nakamise Shopping Street, Asakusa
		do this on the way to ueno 
ueno park exploration for a while
	[Tokyo Cherry Blossom Spots](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3050.html)
	The park itself along with the pond on the southern end of it are open at all hours
		might want to start in the southern end of the park, there is a decently large pond with [Benten Temple](https://maps.app.goo.gl/puCbhZr35RiQ6r4W6) accessable in the middle of it
			The temple closes at 5pm though I'm fairly sure that is an entry and not external viewing (up close) so for wondering around, should be fine
		Most event-ish locations within the park close at 5pm, but the [Tokyo National Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fT58Mzicd1aN8MnW7) remains open until 8pm on Fridays and Saturdays
			If we have some extra time to play with, we might want to look through there for a bit
additional shopping and snacks as we go along - *find location ideas and place them _here_*
	asakusa and ueno
		--

-fill in extra time here if we want

akihabara after dark maybe, possibly in the afternoon
	Places to check out - *modify later*
		Owl Cafe Tokyo

shift over to shibuya afterward
	Shibuya
		[Shibuya crossing](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/2177/)
	 	1,000-2,500 pedestrians cross every two minutes during peak hours
> 			For a nice view of the action, grab a drink in the Starbucks in the QFRONT building and head to the second floor.
> 				A less-trafficked vantage point is in the station itself, between the JR lines and the Keio Inokashira Line entrance.
> 			Shibuya's station front is home to a statue of Hachiko, Japan's most famous dog
> 				When leaving the station from the Hachiko exit, we'll pass the statue of the dog after which the exit is named.
> 					This small public square is commonly used as a meeting place and is watched by a memorial of the Akita-ken dog Hachiko
> 				ample dining, bars, karaoke and theaters
> 					*list spot ideas*
> 			Tower Records
> 				good stop for music/vinyl of Japan's current hits.
> 			shinjuku 3d billboard and meiji temple visit. might want to do in same day as shibuya crossing/shibuya exploration (tokyo half)
> Nakamegura ("Naka-me," as it is colloquially known)
> 	5-minute journey from Shibuya by train
> 	river/canal runs through it
> 		in the spring nearly every tree along the riverside explodes with cherry blossoms, forming a tunnel of flowers over the river
> 			considered one of the best places in Tokyo for flower viewing
> 				note it's also one of the most crowded.
> 			in the evenings, Lanterns illuminate the trees
> 				If the crowds become too much, escape to one of the many side streets for an artisanal coffee or craft beer.

#### Monday 4/14/25 - *find stuff in shinjuku*
Shinjuku stuff
	This has to be one stop because it looks awesome: https://maps.app.goo.gl/JJNkWtQLbW6nhX6h8

#### Tuesday 4/15/25 - *figure out optimal path* \*basic info valid\*
tokyo to osaka train trip
	Hakone - this will be a stopping point when heading to osaka or back to tokyo
> 			might require some back and forth travel (unsure yet as to optimal routes for a given timeframe) 
> 		great visibility of mt fuji from [Lake Ashinoko](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1569/)
> 			accessable by bus from Hakone-Yumoto Station; roughly 35 minute ride
> 			sightseeing boat rides available

> 			nearby is the Hakone Glass Forest Museum
> 				glass trees, crystal bridges, Venetian glass
> 				many displays from world-renowned glass artisan
> 				opportunities to try glassmaking yourself
> 			also nearby is the gora hot spring
> 				if we want to laze around for a while after the hakone air museum, it is roughly 25 minutes away when walking
> 	When train ride is finished (i.e. made it into osaka), find stuff to do that likely wont take much time, or a few things that we are willing to use up time on. With usj happening tomorrow we might not want to do much, as we want to be awake and ready erl in the next day
	

#### Wednesday 4/16/25

from there to [Yamazaki Whisky Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K2aUUAg6NsWudUBB6)

back to hotel
	relax in Osaka and/o kyoto for rest of day

If there is time, go through ueno park, akihara once more, and any other spots that we want to double back on before the flight back tomorrow. Same deal on the Osaka side if there is still stuff that we want to do before the ride back into tokyo

##### events/activities list - filtered from mind map and [Assorted info](Assorted%20info.md)    -------- PLEASE ADD TO THIS LIST IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS IN ANY REGION
###### Mind map
Giant Gundam and Godzilla in shinjuku
	cat islands (specific island location choice tbd) 
	shinjuku 3d billboard and meiji temple visit ()might want to do in same day as shibuya crossing/shibuya exploration (tokyo half)
		shinjuku is halfway between tokyo and shibuya
	find fun shinjuku/shibuya eateries/restaurants/coffee shops/etc.
	look through options for cherry blossom viewing spots that can fit in anywhere on timeline
		Lake Kawaguchi  and Fujiyoshida are supposed to be good spots near mount fuji
	Tenshin-ryu samurai sword art dojo (tokyo)
	japans smallest mountain (sendai) - unlikely due to required time to travel (4 hours north with few other priorities within range of spot)
	Toritsuoshima Park Zoo (in ueno - 20 minute walk north of tokyo hotel)
	tokyo toilet project - transparent toilet rooms are placed IN 2 parks in shibuya (Haru-No-Ogawa Community Park and at Yoyogi Fukamachi Mini Park)
	kyoto international manga museum (1 hour north of osaka hotel)
	unko museum (1 hour south of tokyo hotel)
	kadokawa culture museum (hour and 20 minutes northwest for tokyo hotel) - likely to opt out due to distance with lack of surrounding activities on list
	miharu - giant weeping willow sakura tree (in fukushima - 2 hours 40ish minutes north of tokyo hotel) might be able to tie it in with KCM (line above) but distance still problematic
	find okinawan restaurants near either hotel location (in osaka or tokyo) - would love to try okinawan food, and want to find habushu IF posible
